# Windows 10 Creators Update (1703)

## This is from a custom ISO

The screenshots in this folder are from a clean install of windows using the customised iso image. (no onedrive, cortana, minecraft shortcut, get office shortcut, store, skype, mail, maps, people, feedback hub )

The start menu is pretty clean as there are no annoying store apps or links.

## Notes:

Windows Smartscreen settings have now moved to Windows Security Center options.

Scripts within the previous folder still work ok & apply tweaks as with previous versions of Windows 10.
